## About

This is an approximation of the agar.io game implemented in Clojure and Clojurescript with [Sente](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente) for websockets and [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) for HTML/JS.

This is a fork of [timothypratley](https://github.com/timothypratley/)'s [Snakelake](https://github.com/timothypratley/snakelake) repo. Highly recommend checking it out for a Sente, Reagent, and Figwheel example complete with a Heroku deployment script!
